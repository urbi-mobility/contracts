# contracts
The decentralized, single source of truth. In crypto we trust.

# What does it do?
Check out the [example](./example/index.js) to see how the flow for registration and authentication works.

# How to run
Make sure to have truffle installed. You also need a development Ethereum node to test the contract and run the example. You can use `ganache-cli` or help me testing out [`ethnode`](https://github.com/vrde/ethnode).

```
npm i
truffle migrate
node example/index.js
```
